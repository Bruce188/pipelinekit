## /pipeline orchestrator

The autonomous Charter → Analyze → Plan → Implement → Review → Merge loop. The user provides a feature description; pipelinekit ships a merged PR.

- [#21](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/21) — Switch sandbox providers to exec-style argv (eliminates shell-injection surface)

- [#23](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/23) — Fail-closed when `env-scrub.py` returns unexpected output
- [#24](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/24) — Versioned sandbox base image + build script
- [#48](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/48) — Sandbox unset-default contradiction — `worktree-only` is the correct default

## Research loop + /research

Karpathy-style autoresearch loop (hypothesize → mutate → benchmark → keep-or-reset).

- [#8](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/8) — /research skill — Karpathy autoresearch loop driver
- [#54](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/54) — Add `parse-json` subcommand to `cost_log.py` + wire into research-loop

- [#5](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/5) — Azure CLI overlay (also in deployment providers above)

## Hooks + enforcement

PreToolUse / PostToolUse / SessionStart / etc. hooks that enforce contracts at the Claude Code surface.

- [#19](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/19) — Worker-delegation phase 2 — CodexWorker spec + routing
- [#20](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/20) — Worker-delegation phases 4–5 + `validate-task-spec` hook
- [#33](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/33) — Subagent docs-write block via heredoc convention

- [#66](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/66) — Harden `.mcp.json.template` (pin git refs)

- [#15](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/15) — EnterWorktree / ExitWorktree guidance + Claude Code v2.1.72 version-floor gate

## Worker abstraction

Pluggable worker layer so /pipeline can dispatch to alternate Claude SDKs or external tools.

- (Phase 1 commit) — Worker-provider abstraction layer (phase 1 docs)
- [#19](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/19) — CodexWorker spec + routing (phase 2)
- [#20](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/20) — Phases 4–5 + `validate-task-spec` hook

## Bug fixes

- [#51](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/51) — codex.sh exec bugs — exit-code propagation, output dir, stderr, positional prompt
- [#110](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/110) — un-wire `cost_log.py` from `PostToolUse` (it's a CLI, not a hook — was emitting argparse usage errors on every tool call) + scrub three hardcoded `/home/bruce/pipelinekit/` paths from `task-spec.md`
- [#111](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/111) — README hook inventory: drop `cost_log` (not a hook); 24 → 23
- [#112](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/112) — break `stop-self-reflect` recursion via `PIPELINE_NO_SELF_REFLECT=1` env-var guard on the `claude -p` spawn (memory-thrash root cause)
- *This PR* — add `context-budget-advisor.py` UserPromptSubmit hook: emits a `/compact` advisory once session context passes 200K tokens (configurable via `PIPELINE_COMPACT_THRESHOLD_TOKENS`); re-warns every +20K, resets after a 50K drop. Independent of model window size — even 1M-context models benefit from a reset around 200K because attention quality and per-call cost both degrade as context grows.

## Skill removals (breaking)

- [#29](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/29) — Deprecate `/interview-prp` in favor of `/pipeline` Step 0 Charter Discovery (banner + migration notice; skill still installed)
- [#68](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/68) — Remove deprecated `/interview-prp` skill entirely (second half of 2-release deprecation)
- [#81](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/81) — Remove `openhuman` skill and vendored `agentmemory` retrieval layer (8 orphan agents audited and dropped; installer references scrubbed)
- [#117](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/117) — Remove `stop-self-reflect` Stop hook entirely. Empirical evidence: 28 artifacts written across two projects in ~24h, 100% `{"proposals":[]}` (zero useful CLAUDE.md amendments produced) while burning ~28 min of `claude -p` Opus time + MCP load per session. Hook plus its cost-event integration (originally added in #103), recursion guard (#112), tests, charter Topic 14 ("Self-reflection"), and standalone documentation page all dropped. Charter discovery loses Topic 14; Topic 15 (Codebase Map confirmation) renumbers to Topic 14.
- *This PR* — Remove `annotate-plan` skill (slash command `/annotate-plan`). Inserted in the manual workflow between `/create-plan` and `/implement-plan`; dead-by-disuse for the `/pipeline`-driven flow that drives all production use. Empirical: zero invocations across all session transcripts. Removes the skill dir, the catalog entry, and the slash-command cheatsheet row. The manual workflow stays valid — users can still hand-edit plan files between phases — just without an `/annotate-plan` orchestration helper.

## Documentation system

The system that produces this very page.

- [#6](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/6) — docs-writer post-merge phase + /document-release skill
- [#43](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/43) — docs-vs-documentation format split (markdown for LLMs, HTML for humans)
- [#67](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/67) — Native surface docs + bundled NB cleanup
- [#72](https://github.com/Bruce188/pipelinekit/pull/72) — Docs refresh post-PR44-to-PR71 (cloud providers, /ppr --research, skill/agent counts)
- *This PR* — docs-writer/2 rich-template + interactive HTML throughout `documentation/`

## Counts at end of v0.0.1

- **78** commits on `main`
- **72** numbered pull requests
- **43** native skills
- **31** specialized agents
- **24** hooks (was 23 after #111; the new `context-budget-advisor` restores parity but at the UserPromptSubmit surface, not as a CLI re-wire)
- **5** cloud deployment providers (Azure, Vercel, Railway, Render, DigitalOcean) on a shared `deployment-engineer.md` base
- **18** documentation pages (all self-contained HTML, no CDN, file://-openable)
